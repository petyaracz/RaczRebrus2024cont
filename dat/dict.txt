date 	date of borrowing for word. okay this is from uesz (see above), which I painstakingly automated by curling and parsing the pdfs (that's all those scripts) and then hand-checked to make sure I take the year that refers to the current meaning (you have to believe me on this one) and then there were some 12 words left not in UESZ and I used google ngrams and the english etymology as well as arcanum (see above) to guesstimate first time of use for those. so yes this is a bit hectic.
